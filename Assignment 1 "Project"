#Aim: Practice data download to annotation and differential expression
#1- Download data: 
#2- Preparation of data --> construct 5 samples, each has 2 parts: 1M uniq reads, 1M random reads(shuffled)
#3- Fastq quality controlfor sample 1 only using FASTQC and report the difference between S1_1 and S1_2
#4- Trimming for all samples --> mild trimming sor Sx_1 and aggressive trimming for S1_2
#5- Alignment of all samples using BWA and Hisat against human reference file
# - Export statistical report for each sample
#6- Assembly --> apply reference based transcriptome assembly using string tie --> 5 samples without shuffeling and 5 other samples
#where shuffeling applied
#7- Using GTF, compare generated annotation to reference annotation
#8- Apply differential expression
